## Important to Note

As React Native Storybook have not been updated for a year by the storybook developer so when displaying the app, it would display a bit slow, none of it was my fault.

I have already reduce the lagging of the app by a little by separate some of the content in different stories so if it still lagging sometimes, close the app and open again.

## Setup

1. Launch `yarn install` to install the packages.
2. Launch `yarn android` if you are using android else if using iOS then run `cd ios && pod install && cd .. && yarn ios` to run storybook on mobile devices.
